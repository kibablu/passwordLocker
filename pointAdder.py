'''
We split the text along its newlines to get a list in which each item is one line of the text. (line 9)
We store the list in lines and then loop through the items in lines. (line 9 and 10)
For each line, we add a star and a space to the start of the line. Now each string in lines begins with a star. (line 11)
'''

'''
(line 13)
The lines list now contains modified lines that start with stars. But
pyperclip.copy() is expecting a single string value, not a list of string values.
To make this single string value, pass lines into the join() method to get a
single string joined from the listâ€™s strings.
